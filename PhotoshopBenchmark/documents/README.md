Due to their large size the files for the benchmarks are stored on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MuZjsiItuB2Mood4LfugEiTO8RLim5PX?usp=sharing) and need to be 
downloaded and moved into this folder with their sub-folders intact.

If done correctly there should be a read/ directory with all the files and an empty write/ directory which will be populated by the benchmarks
