Python Bindings
===============

Below you can find a view of the main classes you will be interacting with when using the PhotoshopAPI python bindings.

You will find that these do not match the C++ functions 100% in an attempt to make the python bindings pythonic,
therefore not all functions can be translated directly 

.. caution::

	The python bindings, much like the PhotoshopAPI itself are still in early development and therefore
	subject to change. If you have any suggestions on how to improve them feel free to leave an issue on
	the github repo
