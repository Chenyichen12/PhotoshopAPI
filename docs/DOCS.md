# Documentation

The documentation consists of two parts, for one we have the documentation for the [PhotoshopFileFormat](./PhotoshopFileFormat/README.md) which attempts to offer a more concrete and correct documentation of the file structure of Photoshop Documents as the one presented by Adobe itself is not always correct or complete. This is currently not completed and still a work in progress

The second part is documentation specific to the PhotoshopAPI, this documentation is hosted on [ReadTheDocs](https://photoshopapi.readthedocs.io/)
