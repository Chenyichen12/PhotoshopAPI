# Documentation

The documentation consists of two parts, for one we have the documentation for the [PhotoshopFileFormat](./PhotoshopFileFormat/README.md) which attempts to offer a more concrete and correct documentation of the file structure of Photoshop Documents as the one presented by Adobe itself is not always correct or complete. 

The second part is documentation and examples specific to PhotoshopAPI, all of the example are in markdown form but do compile to valid C++ code (assuming the library is properly included and linked).
